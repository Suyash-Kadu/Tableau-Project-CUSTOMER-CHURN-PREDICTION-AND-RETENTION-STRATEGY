# Tableau-Project-CUSTOMER-CHURN-PREDICTION-RETENTION-STRATEGY
Leveraging a dataset of over 7,000 customer records, I've identified the critical factors driving churn and developed targeted retention insights.

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 & 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀:-
𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗥𝗶𝘀𝗸: Customers on Month-to-month contracts are the highest risk, with a massive 42.74% churn rate in this group. This compares to only 2.93% for Two-Year contracts. 

𝗢𝗻𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗜𝘀𝘀𝘂𝗲: The most vulnerable period is the start of the customer relationship , with the 1-15 Months tenure group being the largest segment (34.84% of all customers) and showing the highest overall churn volume.

𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲: Fiber optic customers have the highest count (2,918) and represent the highest volume of No churn customers (1,432, suggesting a high volume of churn in this group as well).

Created an interactive dashboard to monitor these trends and provide actionable insights.
